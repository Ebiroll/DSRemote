DSRemote 0.1
------------

When opening a connection, the program reads the settings from the device.
It does not lock the device, so it's still possible to change settings on the device.
This will cause a mismatch between the programs settings and the device settings.
This can be solved by letting the program re-read the settings of the device.
At this moment, the only way to do that is to disconnect and connect again.
Some settings are checked regularly and will always be synchronized:
- trigger status
- trigger sweep
- samplerate
- memory depth


Number of screen updates is approx. 20 waveforms per second.

Use the mousewheel to change the dials. In order to simulate a push on a dial,
click on it with the right mouse button.

In addition of using the dials to change the scale and offset of the traces and the trigger position,
you can use the mouse to drag the yellow and orange arrows aside of the plot.


What's implemented so far:
--------------------------

- horizontal timebase
- horizontal offset
- horizontal timebase delay on/off
  (display is not yet implemented)
- horizontal vernier


- vertical sensitivity
- vertical offset
- vertical bandwith limit
- vertical coupling (ac/dc/gnd)
- vertical display channel on/off
- vertical vernier
- vertical invert


- basic trigger settings like:
- run/stop, single, auto
- trigger holdoff
- trigger source (chan1/4, ext, ext5, ac)
- trigger edge (positive, negative, rising edge & falling edge)
- trigger level
- trigger level 50%
- trigger force


- measure hardware frequency counter


- display clear
- display grid
- display grading
- display vectors
- display dots


- acquire normal
- acquire average


- save screenshot
- save display data (raw waveform, the part that is visible on the screen)
  saving deep memory is not yet implemented
  fileformat for waveform data is EDF, these files can be read by lots
  of viewers and analyzing software like EDFbrowser, Scilab, Octave, Matlab, Labview, etc.
